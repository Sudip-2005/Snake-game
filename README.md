1. **Create a `README.md` file** in your GitHub repo and paste this in.
2. (Optional) Take a screenshot of the game and save it as `screenshot.png` in the same folder.
3. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to officially make it open-source (MIT is most common).

Let me know if you'd like a version with emojis removed or simplified formatting.
